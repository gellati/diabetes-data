# Diabetes data analysis

Data and software used for the analysis of [this](https://github.com/mrinnetmaki/mydata) diabetes data set.

Data in their original folders, and cleaned up data in the CleanData folder. Each variable has its own file, and timestamps have been converted to Unix time.

Visualisation programs in the visualisation folder. Both timeseries and networks visualised. Run the data.py program to see a popup of the network visualisation, and open the .html files in a browser. 

Some documentation files in the docs folder.

Programs written in Python, and dependencies listed in the requirements.txt (for those that have a __version__ attribute). Used also [netpython](https://github.com/CxAalto/netpython) and [himmeli](https://github.com/CxAalto/himmeli_3.0.1) libraries. Cooperation with [bolozna](https://github.com/bolozna).

Programs written for the [MyData hackathon](http://mydata2016.org/ultrhahack) 30.8-1.9.2016
